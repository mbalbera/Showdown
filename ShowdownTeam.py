# ShowdownTeam.py

"""This module contains all aspects of teams in a Showdown game.
Attributes (members) of a team are all of type PlayerCard & include:
a lineup, starting pitching staff, relief pitching staff, and bench.
A valid team includes the following 20 PlayerCard members:
A lineup of 9 cards, one who plays each position (including DH)
A starting pitching staff of 4 cards
A relief corps of 1-4 cards & a bench of 3-6 cards, totaling 7 cards between the two

One starting pitcher is designated as the active starting pitcher using a boolean value.
