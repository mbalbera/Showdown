"""Controller module for Showdown card game.

This module contains the subcontroller to play a single game of Showdown.
Instances reflect a single game.  To play a new game, make a new instance of Gameplay.

This subcontroller manages the following and all associated die rolls:
inning number and top/bottom, the score, the current pitcher and batter, at-bats, pitches, swings,
which cards are on which bases & are thus allowed to take which actions, and the aforementioned actions.
