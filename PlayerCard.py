# PlayerCard.py

"""This module contains the aspects of batter and pitcher Showdown Cards.
Attributes include point value, position, control (pitchers only), on-base (batters only), and outcome ranges.
Outcome ranges for pitchers include Out(PU), Out(SO), Out(GB), Out(FB), BB, 1B, 2B, and HR.
Outcome ranges for pitchers include Out(SO), Out(GB), Out(FB), BB, 1B, 1B+ 2B, 3B and HR.
